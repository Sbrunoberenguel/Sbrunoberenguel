# Hello world !

## I am Bruno Berenguel-Baeta <p> Post-Doctoral researcher in Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.

### **About my persona**

I started my Engineering degree in 2012, in the [Universidad de Zaragoza](http://www.unizar.es). Then, in 2017, the 2-year Masters on Engineering followed. In my second year, I participated in the Erasmus+ program and went to the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de) (Germany) were I started to learn computer vision and deep learning. The Erasmus was followed by an internship at Universidad de Zaragoza, in the [Department of Computer Science and Systems Enginnering](https://diis.unizar.es). 

In December 2019, I presented my Master's Thesis on omnidirectional images under the supervision of my advisors ([JesÃºs Bermudez-Cameo](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~bermudez/) and [Josechu Guerrero](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~jguerrer/)), which was the results of the internship in the department. 


### **Ph.D** 

My Ph.D started in January 2020 in the same department and with the same advisors with which I did my Master's thesis (Why should I change something that works?). At that moment, my life as Ph.D student started. Though, the starting time was not the best ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·ðŸ¦ , it allowed my to focus on publishing with less distractions (also called life). In December 2023 I finally read my thesis [Learning the surroundings: 3D scene understanding from omnidirectional images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YPdCtLuTq-EEBR5WCEvkYAlIFVJMmzWC/view?usp=sharing), achieving the calification of *cum laude*.

My research interest is on ***Computer Vision*** and ***Deep learning***, and more specifically, *scene understanding from omnidirectional images*. I am also interested on geometrical and photometric approaches inside the computer vision field. I do have some experience on geometrical solutions (with great help of my advisors), but I have mostly focused on deep learning solutions in these last years. In my research stay in the [CNRS-AIST JRL](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/en/index.html) (Japan), I also got many help from fellow researchers on photometric approaches and with the combinations of methods I started in the field of practical applications of omnidirectional cameras.

Here I present a collection of the publications where I participated and the available code of some of them.
